No contribution is too small—bug fixes and documentation updates are valid ways of participating. 2017 will mark the 4th year for Hacktoberfest!</p> <p>Rules and Prizes</p> <p>To participate, first sign up on the Hacktoberfest site . And if you open up four pull requests between October 1 and October 31, you'll win a free, limited edition Hacktoberfest T-shirt.
